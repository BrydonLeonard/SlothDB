# SlothDB 

My entrant for the "Slowest DB in the world" competition. 

This version of the DB was built as a throwaway while I was learning about LSM trees. It'll be re-implemented more efficiently soon. Read my blog post about it [here](https://brydonleonard.github.io/learning/rust/databases/2024/05/25/rust-slothdb-1.html)
